# Centos Firewall

## firewall-cmd

CentOS 8 comes with a dynamic, customizable host-based firewall with a D-Bus interface. 
You can add or delete or update firewall rules without restarting the firewall daemon or service. 
The `firewall-cmd` acts as a frontend for the `nftables`. In CentOS 8 `nftables` replaces `iptables` as the default Linux network packet filtering framework.

### Commands

- `sudo firewall-cmd --state` - check status
- `sudo systemctl start firewalld` - start
- `sudo systemctl enable firewalld` - enable
- `firewall-cmd --get-zones` - get all zones
- `firewall-cmd --get-default-zone`
- `sudo firewall-cmd --list-all` - list firewall rules
- `sudo firewall-cmd --reload` - apply changes in rules
- `sudo firewall-cmd --add-service http` - allow HTTP connections on port 80
- `sudo firewall-cmd --remove-service=http --permanent` - restrict connection to port 80
- `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp`
- `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-port=80/tcp`

### Configuration for docker

```bash
# trust the docker interface
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --change-interface=docker0
# accept IPv4 traffic
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 4 -i docker0 -j ACCEPT
# any ports on the host you want to access from the containers (strapi port 1337 here)
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-port=1337/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
service docker restart
```

## iptables

### Restart iptables

```
service iptables restart
# Or
systemctl restart iptables
```

### Show current iptables rules

```
iptables -L -v -n --line-num
```

`num` will help us to delete rule.

### Delete rule by num

Delete rule 3 in the chain `OUTPUT`:

```
iptables -D OUTPUT 3
```

### Deny connections from IP

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 155.10.10.55 -j DROP
```

### Allow connections from IP to port 3306

#### Via console command

List numbers of existing rules:

```
iptables -L -v -n --line-num
```

We're interested in the `INPUT` section in the output. Define a number of a new rule. If it's 24 than the command will be:

```
iptables -I INPUT 24 -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp -s 10.200.1.11 --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT
```

the following will occur:

- The existing rule at line 24 (and all rules below it) will be shifted down by one position.
- Your new rule will take its place at line 24.
- The old rule 24 becomes rule 25, rule 25 becomes 26, and so on.
- No rules are overwritten or lostâ€”they are renumbered sequentially.
- The new rule is inserted at the exact position you specified, which is critical because iptables processes rules top-to-bottom.

The `iptables -I` (insert) command applies the rule immediately to the running kernel's firewall.

Changes take effect instantly without requiring a restart.

#### Via editing a file

Add line to file `/etc/sysconfig/iptables`:

```
# Allow connections for company Hello.com
-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 3306 -s 200.120.60.10 -j ACCEPT
```

Save the iptables rule (so it persists after a reboot): 

```
service iptables save
```

Restart iptables (optional, to ensure rules are applied): 

```
service iptables restart
```

### Open port 80

```
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --sport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
```
Here:
- `-I` - insert to the beginning of the list of rules
- `-A` - append to the end

### Allow outgoing connections to IP

```
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp -d 194.88.12.253 -j ACCEPT
```

### Deny outgoing connections to domain

Prevent outgoing connections from our server to mysite.hi.com:

```
iptables -A OUTPUT -m string --algo bm --string "mysite.hi.com" -j DROP
```

### Flush All Rules, Delete All Chains, Accept All

First, set the default policies for each of the built-in chains to `ACCEPT`. 
The main reason to do this is to ensure that you won't be locked out from your server via SSH:

```
sudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
```

Then flush the `nat` and `mangle` tables, flush all chains (`-F`), and delete all non-default chains (`-X`):

```
sudo iptables -t nat -F
sudo iptables -t mangle -F
sudo iptables -F
sudo iptables -X
```

Your firewall will now allow all network traffic. If you list your rules now, you will see there are none, and only the three default chains (`INPUT`, `FORWARD`, and `OUTPUT`) remain.
