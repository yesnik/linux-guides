# Fluentd

[Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/) is an open source data collector for unified logging layer.
Fluentd allows you to unify data collection and consumption for a better use and understanding of data.

It's written in СRuby.

## Advantages

- It consumes few resources
- Unified logging: Collects from various sources and normalizes them into a standard format.
- Flexibility and Extensibility: Plugin-based architecture and customizability.
- Scalability and Reliability: Handles high volumes of data with buffering and retry mechanisms.
- Data routing and delivery: Supports multiple output destinations and dynamic routing.
- Open source and community-driven: Free to use and with a large and active community.

## Config

File `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf` or `/etc/fluent/fluentd.conf`. It has blocks:

- `source` — info about data source. We can have many `source` blocks in a config file;
- `match` — has info about where to pass received data;
- `include` — info about file types;
- `system` — has system settings.

Plugins are used to connect to desired data source. Standard Plugins: `http` (for receiving HTTP-messages), `forward` (for receiving TCP-packets).

### Source section

```
# Receive events from port 24224 /tcp
<source>
  type forward
  port 24224 
</source>

# http://this.host:9880/myapp.access?json={"event":"data"}
<source>
  type http
  port 9880
</source>
```

Every event from the data source has attributes: 

- `tag` - helps to understand where to route messages
- `time` - define here time
- `record` - data in JSON format

Message example:

```
# Generated by http://this.host:9880/myapp.access?json={"event":"data"}
tag: myapp.access
time: (current time)
record: {"event":"data"}
```

### Match section

Describe features to select desired events. Standard output plugins: `file` and `forward`.

```
# Get events from port 24224
<source>
  type forward
  port 24224
</source>

# http://this.host:9880/myapp.access?json={"event":"data"}
<source>
  type http
  port 9880
</source>

# Take events with a tag "myapp.access" 
# and save them to a file /var/log/fluent/access.%Y-%m-%d
<match myapp.access>
  type file
  path /var/log/fluent/access
</match>
```
It means that all events marked with tags `myapp` and `access` we need to save to `/var/log/fluent/access`.
Events with any additional tag won't be sent to this file.

#### Match syntax

- `<match a.*>` - selects `a.b` tag, but not `a.b.c`
- `<match **>` - selects any tag: `a` и `a.b`, `a.b.c`
- `<match {a, b}>` - selects at least one of defined tags: `a`, `b`, but not `c`
- `<match {a, b}. c.*>`, `<match {a.*, b}.c>*` - we can mix `{}` with `*`, `**`
- `<match a b>` - selects `a` and `b` at once
- `<match a.** b.*>` - selects tags `a`, `a.b` and `a.b.c` (left part) and `b.d` (right часть).

**Important**: Positon of `match` tags important in the config file. In the beginning we need to place concrete rules and after that only general rules. 

Correct example where general rules are at the bottom:

```
<match myapp.access>
  type file
  path /var/log/fluent/access
</match>

<match **>
  type blackhole_plugin
</match>
```

### Extract section

It helps to extract fields from a message.

```
<source>
  @type exec
  command echo '{"value": 2, "action": "update"}'
  run_interval 5s
  <parse>
    @type json
  </parse>
  <extract>
    tag_key action
  </extract>
</source>
```

This config will extract field `action`. Later we use this value as a tag.

### Inject section

The inject section can be under `<match>` or `<filter>` section. 
It is enabled for the plugins that support injecting values to the event record.

```
<match **>
  @type stdout

  <inject>
    hostname_key "hostname"
    hostname "#{Socket.gethostname}"
    tag_key tag
  </inject>
</match>
```

As a result, a message will be sent to `stdout`, the body of which will contain a `tag` field with the value of the message tag assigned by fluentd, 
as well as a `hostname` field with the value of the host name of the node on which the fluentd process is running.

## Plugins

### Input plugins

See https://docs.fluentd.org/input

#### `in_forward`

The `in_forward` Input plugin listens to a TCP socket to receive the event stream. 
It also listens to a UDP socket to receive heartbeat messages. 
If you want to receive events from raw TCP payload, use in_tcp plugin instead.

```
<source>
  @type forward
  port 24224
  bind 0.0.0.0
</source>

<match *>
  @type stdout
  <buffer>
    @type memory
    total_limit_size 100m
    chunk_limit_size 10m
    flush_interval 30s
    flush_at_shutdown true
  </buffer>
</match>
```

*Options:*

- `total_limit_size 100m` - max log storage in case of failure of the output channel. If buffer size is equal to this limit, log write will fail, and log message will be lost.
- `chunk_limit_size 10m` - chunk size to split messages in the buffer.
- `flush_interval 30s` - flush interval.
- `flush_at_shutdown true` - flush log data as shutdown.
- `chunk_limit_records 5000` - the max number of events that each chunks can store in it.

#### `in_tail`

The `in_tail` Input plugin allows Fluentd to read events from the tail of text files. Its behavior is similar to the `tail -F` command.

Read all '*.log' files in the directory `/var/log` and subdirectories. 

```
<source>
  @type tail

  path /var/log/**/*.log
  exclude_path ["/var/log/fluent/*"]
  pos_file /var/log/fluentd/all_logs.pos
  tag app1.*

  <parse>
    @type none
  </parse>
</source>
```

### Filter plugins

See https://docs.fluentd.org/filter

### Parser

See https://docs.fluentd.org/parser

#### apache2

```
<source>
  @type tail
  # ...
  <parse>
    @type apache2
  </parse>
</source>
```

#### json

The json parser plugin parses JSON logs. One JSON map per line.

```
<source>
  @type tail
  path /var/log/app.json.log
  tag myapp

  <parse>
    @type json
  </parse>
</source>
```

#### regexp

```
<source>
  @type tail
  path /var/log/app.log
  tag myapp

  <parse>
    @type regexp
    expression /^\[(?<logtime>[^\]]*)\] (?<name>[^ ]*) (?<title>[^ ]*) (?<id>\d*)$/
    time_key logtime
    time_format %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z
    types id:integer
  </parse>
</source>
```
This incoming event:

```
[2013-02-28 12:00:00 +0900] alice engineer 1
```

is parsed as:

```
time:
1362020400 (2013-02-28 12:00:00 +0900)

record:
{
  "name" : "alice",
  "title": "engineer",
  "id"   : 1
}
```
### Filter plugins

See https://docs.fluentd.org/filter

#### filter_record_transformer

The filter_record_transformer filter plugin mutates/transforms incoming event streams in a versatile manner. If there is a need to add/delete/modify events, this plugin is the first filter to try.

```
<filter foo.bar>
  @type record_transformer
  <record>
    hostname "#{Socket.gethostname}"
    tag ${tag}
  </record>
</filter>
```

The above filter adds the new field hostname with the server's hostname as its value (It is taking advantage of Ruby's string interpolation) 
and the new field tag with tag value.

So, an input like:

```
{"message":"hello world!"}
```

is transformed into

```
{"message":"hello world!", "hostname":"db001.internal.example.com", "tag":"foo.bar"}
```

### Output plugins

See https://docs.fluentd.org/output

#### out_rewrite_tag_filter

When a message is handled by the plugin, the rules are tested one by one in order. 
If a matching rule is found, the message tag will be rewritten according to the definition in the rule and the message will be emitted again with the new tag.

```
<match apache.access>
  @type rewrite_tag_filter

  <rule>
    key code
    pattern /([45][0-9]{2})/
    tag apache.$1
  </rule>
</match>
```

This filter processes messages with the tag `apache.access`. It takes field `code` from 400 to 599 and update a tag to `apache.CODE_VALUE`.

Later we can process these messages:

```
<match {apache.4**,apache.5**}>
  @type stdout
</match>
```
**Important:** No space between `apache.4**,` and `apache.5**`.

### out_forward

The `out_forward` Buffered Output plugin forwards events to other fluentd nodes. 
This plugin supports load-balancing and automatic fail-over (i.e. active-active backup). For replication, please use `out_copy` plugin.

```
<source>
  @type tail

  tag host01.localfile
  path /tmp/app.log

  <parse>
    @type none
  </parse>
</source>

<match *.localfile>
  @type forward

  <server>
    host 192.168.0.20
  </server>

  <buffer>
    timekey 1m
  </buffer>
</match>
```

This config passes logs from `/tmp/app.log` to remote Fluentd server.

## Config examples

File `/etc/fluent/fluentd.conf`.

### From file to syslog

```
<source>
  @type tail
  path /var/log/app.log
  pos_file /var/log/app.log.pos
  tag fluentd
  format apache2
</source>

## Match tag 'fluentd' logs and forward to local syslog
<match fluentd>
  @type remote_syslog
  host 127.0.0.1
  port 514
  protocol udp
</match>
```
