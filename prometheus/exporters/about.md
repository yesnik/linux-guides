# About Prometheus Exporters

[Prometheus exporters](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/) help in exporting existing metrics from third-party systems as Prometheus metrics.

We can find exporter in Google. For example, type "redis exporter" or "mysql exporter".

It's recommended to run all exporters via Docker except `node_exporter`.
