# Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine.
As the heart of the free and open ELK or Elastic Stack, it securely stores your data for lightning fast search, 
fineâ€‘tuned relevancy, and powerful analytics that scale with ease.

Elasticsearch provides near real-time search and analytics for all types of data. 
Whether you have structured or unstructured text, numerical data, or geospatial data, 
Elasticsearch can efficiently store and index it in a way that supports fast searches.

## Docker Compose

Use [official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/elasticsearch)

```yaml
services:
    elasticsearch:
        image: elasticsearch:8.14.1
        environment:
            - discovery.type=single-node
            - xpack.security.enabled=false
        ports:
            - '9200:9200'
            - '9300:9300'
```

## Example

### Create index

Create index `products`: 

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/products
```

Response: 

```json
{
   "acknowledged":true,
   "shards_acknowledged":true,
   "index":"products"
}
```

### Write to index

Let's index a sample product into the *products* index:

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "name": "A book",
"description": "This is a book about PHP", "price": 2.99, "category": "PHP" }' http://localhost:9200/products/_doc
```

Response: 

```json
{
   "_index":"products",
   "_id":"Ck2WgpABCr4ftKxEa4M3",
   "_version":1,
   "result":"created",
   "_shards":{
      "total":2,
      "successful":1,
      "failed":0
   },
   "_seq_no":0,
   "_primary_term":1
}
```

### Search in the index

Issue the following command to search for products containing the term "book" in their name:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/products/_search?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d' { "query": { "match": { "name": "book" } } }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "took" : 211,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 4,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 0.11474907,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "products",
        "_id" : "Ck2WgpABCr4ftKxEa4M3",
        "_score" : 0.11474907,
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "A book",
          "description" : "This is a book about PHP",
          "price" : 2.99,
          "category" : "PHP"
        }
      },
      // ...
    ]
  }
}
```
