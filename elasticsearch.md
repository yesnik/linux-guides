# Elasticsearch

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html) is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine.
As the heart of the free and open ELK or Elastic Stack, it securely stores your data for lightning fast search, 
fineâ€‘tuned relevancy, and powerful analytics that scale with ease.

Elasticsearch provides near real-time search and analytics for all types of data. 
Whether you have structured or unstructured text, numerical data, or geospatial data, 
Elasticsearch can efficiently store and index it in a way that supports fast searches.

## Installation

See: [Official Installation Docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html)

### Archive

```
cd opt
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-8.17.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-8.17.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sha512

tar -xzf elasticsearch-8.17.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd elasticsearch-8.17.2/
./bin/elasticsearch
```

### Docker

Use [official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/elasticsearch)

```yaml
services:
    elasticsearch:
        image: elasticsearch:8.14.1
        environment:
            - discovery.type=single-node
            - xpack.security.enabled=false
            - "ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m"
        ports:
            - '9200:9200'
            - '9300:9300'
```

## Configuration

See [Configuring Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/settings.html)

By default config is used `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`.

Also we can use `-E` option to set param:

```bash
./bin/elasticsearch -d -Ecluster.name=mycluster -Enode.name=mynode
```

### Config for cluster

On each node `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`:

```yml
cluster.name: my_es_cluster
# !!! Set unique name for each Node !!!
node.name: my-es-node-1
node.master: true
node.data: true
# !!! Set private IP of Node !!!
network.host: 10.129.0.8

http.port: 9200
# !!! Set private IPs of all nodes, including current node !!!
discovery.seed_hosts: ["10.129.0.8", "10.129.0.22","10.129.0.9"]
# !!! Set nodes that can become master !!!
cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["my-es-node-1", "my-es-node-2","my-es-node-3"]
path.data: /var/lib/elasticsearch
path.logs: /var/log/elasticsearch
```
Stop elastic on all nodes:
```
service elasticsearch stop
```

Remove folder with data:
```
rm -rf /var/lib/elasticsearch/*
```

One by one start elastic on all nodes:
```
service elasticsearch start
```

### Disable security

Edit config file:

```yml
# Enable security features
xpack.security.enabled: false
```

## Console commands

- Reset Elasticsearch password:
    ```
    /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic
    ```

- Create token for Kibana:
    ```
    /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana
    ```

## Query Examples

Use *Management / Dev Tools* in Kibana to play with API Requests: http://127.0.0.1:5601/app/dev_tools#/console

Make request to secured Elasticsearch:

```bash
curl -k -X GET "https://elastic:dd8xv5On+uZkVmdC9WoK@158.150.50.111:9200"
```

### Get info about Elasticearch

URL: http://127.0.0.1:9200/

Response:

```json
{
  "name" : "some-host",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "DHGqhGACRVS-f_62We_Xag",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "8.17.2",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_type" : "deb",
    "build_hash" : "747663ddda3421467150de0e4301e8d4bc636b0c",
    "build_date" : "2025-02-05T22:10:57.067596412Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "9.12.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "7.17.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "7.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

### Create index

We can place document in the index by this URL: `/{index}/{type}/{id}`.

```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"message":"Hi"}' http://localhost:9200/my_index/my_type

{"_index":"my_index","_type":"my_type","_id":"Cv35a3Usez99Q6irxZfL","_version":1,"result":"created","_shards":{"total":2,"successful":1,"failed":0},"_seq_no":2,"_primary_term":2}
```

This query created index with `my_index` name and `my_type` type and placed the document in this index. It generated Id for the document. 

We can set document Id `MyId001` in the query:

```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"message":"Hi"}' http://localhost:9200/my_index/my_type/MyId001

{"_index":"my_index","_type":"my_type","_id":"MyId001","_version":1,"result":"created","_shards":{"total":2,"successful":1,"failed":0},"_seq_no":3,"_primary_term":2}
```

Create index `products`: 

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/products

{
   "acknowledged":true,
   "shards_acknowledged":true,
   "index":"products"
}
```

There is a maximum number of documents you can have in a *single Lucene index*. As of LUCENE-5843, the limit is 2 147 483 519 (`Integer.MAX_VALUE - 128`) documents.


#### `number_of_shards`, `number_of_replicas`

When you create an index, you can configure both values in the settings of that index:

```
curl -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"settings": {"index.number_of_shards": 3, "index.number_of_replicas": 2}}' http://localhost:9200/myindex
```

Also note that you can update the settings of an index after its creation, but you can only update the number of replicas and not the number of primary shards:

```
curl -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"settings": {"index.number_of_replicas": 2}}' http://localhost:9200/myindex/_settings
```

Optimal shard's size is 30-50 Gb. If we want to store 90 Gb of logs per day, we need 90 / 30 = 3 shards in the index.

### Show indices

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices
```

### Write to index

#### One write

Let's add a product into the *products* index:

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name": "A book", "price": 2.99}' http://localhost:9200/products/_doc
```

Response: 

```json
{
   "_index":"products",
   "_id":"Ck2WgpABCr4ftKxEa4M3",
   "_version":1,
   "result":"created",
   "_shards":{
      "total":2,
      "successful":1,
      "failed":0
   },
   "_seq_no":0,
   "_primary_term":1
}
```

#### Bulk write

```bash
curl -X POST "localhost:9200/_bulk?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{ "index" : { "_index" : "products" } }
{"name": "Pencil", "price": 4.50}
{ "index" : { "_index" : "products" } }
{"name": "Pen", "price": 1.30}
{ "index" : { "_index" : "products" } }
{"name": "Car", "price": 7000}
'
```

### Show all documents, limit 100 records

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/_search?pretty&size=100"

{
  "took": 0,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 0,
    "successful": 0,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 0,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": 0,
    "hits": []
  }
}
```

- `took` - cluster execution time, ms;
- `timed_out: false` - was timeout during search;
- `_shards`  - shows how many shards were queried among the whole cluster;
- `hits` - docs amount;
- `max_score` - shows the best results amount;
- `hits` - shows documents list.

### Show all documents in the index

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/products/_search?pretty"
```

### Search in two indeces

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/products,my_index/_search"
```

### Search by type in all indeces

If we have several indeces that contain the same type:

```bash
curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/_all/product/_search
```

### Search in the index

#### match

We can use the `match` query to search for documents that contain a specific value in a specific field. 
This is the standard query for performing full-text search, including fuzzy matching and phrase searches.

Let's search for products containing the term "book" in their name:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/products/_search?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d' { "query": { "match": { "name": "book" } } }'
```

#### range

Search products with `price >= 1` and `price <= 3`:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/products/_search?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d' { "query": { "range": { "price": { "gte": 1, "lte": 3 }  } } }'
```

### Cluster commands

- `GET /_cat/shards` - Show shards info
- `GET /_cat/shards/myindex` - Show shards for index
- `GET /_cluster/state?pretty` - Get info about cluster
- `GET /_cluster/health?pretty` - Check cluster state
- `GET /_cat/master/?pretty` - Show master node in cluster
